# Technical Test by Purée Maison agency

> To get a work-study contract at Purée Maison, I did a small technical test of web integration focused on css and javascript animations. Particular attention was paid to the approach used: nomenclature, modularity and project's structure. I had 24 hours to do this test and it was more important to refine some animations than to integrate everything.

There are two branches of this project:
- [24h branch](https://github.com/TibereDbzt/testpureemaison/tree/24h) --> what I produced after 24 hours (about 9 hours of work).
- **YOUR ARE HERE** [main branch](https://github.com/TibereDbzt/testpureemaison) --> the full integration, because I really liked the exercise and I wanted to finish this little project.
